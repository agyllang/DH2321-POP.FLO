                <p>POP.FLO is a tool that gives you the possibility to
                    visualize moving patterns within Sweden, between Swedish counties, "l√§n".
                </p>
                <p>Sweden has 21 counties - which shouldn't be mixed up
                    with the Swedish provinces, "landskap", of which there are 25. The counties have political
                    and admininistrative powers, the provinces have not.
